# Multi-Class-Weather-Classification-Using-Different-CNN-Models
This project built a Custom CNN Model using different Convolutional, Pooling, and Dense layers. Then, the Custom built CNN Model is compared to those of state-of-the-art pre-trained CNN models such as VGG16, ResNet50,  and MobileNetV2.
